HTML5- Match 3
===============

Demo: http://mfirdaus.net/random/match3.htm

A generic match 3 puzzle game built in HTML5. Technically speaking, this is probably a HTML4.1 App as it doesn't use any HTML5 functionality or anything. But that's not cool. HTML5 is cool. Enough Said.

It's buy me coffee license. Also purely educational so don't sue.
